Vector Integration Progress Summary
Current Status
We've been working on integrating vector embeddings for both prompts and responses in the LLM service, specifically storing them in the content_vector field of the grp_con_avatar_turns table.

Key Issues Encountered
Vector Format Issue:
Initially, vectors were being sent with curly braces {} but PostgreSQL's vector type requires square brackets []
Fixed by updating the formatting in llm.js
Vector Dimension Mismatch:
The database column was defined as vector(1536) (for OpenAI embeddings)
Anthropic's Claude model returns 32-dimensional vectors
Attempted to modify the column to be dimension-agnostic, but ran into index creation issues
Index Creation Problem:
The ivfflat index requires a fixed dimension
Attempted to modify the column to vector(96) (a multiple of 32) but need to verify if this is compatible with the index
Next Steps
Database Schema Update:
Need to run the SQL to modify the content_vector column to accept the correct dimension
Consider whether to:
Use a fixed dimension that's compatible with both models (e.g., 96)
Or modify the index type to support dynamic dimensions
Testing:
After schema changes, test with both OpenAI and Anthropic models
Verify that vectors are being stored and retrieved correctly
Error Handling:
Add more detailed error logging for vector-related operations
Consider adding validation for vector dimensions before insertion
Performance:
Monitor the performance impact of the vector operations
Consider adding caching for frequently accessed vectors
SQL To Run (First Thing Tomorrow)
sql
CopyInsert
-- Drop existing index
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS dev.idx_grp_con_avatar_turns_content_vector;

-- Alter the column to use a fixed dimension that works with your models
ALTER TABLE dev.grp_con_avatar_turns 
ALTER COLUMN content_vector TYPE vector(96);

-- Recreate the index
CREATE INDEX idx_grp_con_avatar_turns_content_vector 
ON dev.grp_con_avatar_turns 
USING ivfflat (content_vector vector_cosine_ops) 
WITH (lists = 100);
Notes for Tomorrow
Check if the vector dimension (96) is appropriate for your use case
Be prepared to adjust the dimension or index type based on testing
Consider adding a migration file to track these schema changes
Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points when you continue working on this!
