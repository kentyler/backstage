File Upload Implementation Summary
Today we successfully implemented a complete file upload system integrated with Supabase storage. We addressed several critical issues and added robust error handling for large file processing.

Accomplishments
Fixed Supabase Integration
Ensured files are properly uploaded to schema-specific buckets in Supabase
Added proper error handling and bucket verification
Fixed column naming issues in database queries
Solved Memory Management Issues
Identified and fixed JavaScript heap out-of-memory errors during large file processing
Implemented delayed processing using setTimeout instead of immediate processing
Added verification steps to ensure database records exist before vectorization
Fixed Foreign Key Constraint Issues
Identified that constraints were incorrectly referencing public.file_uploads instead of the schema-specific table
Documented SQL fix to update the constraints for multi-tenant architecture
Enhanced error logging for constraint violations
Improved Message Ordering
Fixed issue with file upload messages appearing at the top of conversations
Updated frontend to use message count for turn index calculation
Added proper turn index preservation in message formatting
Current System State
File uploads work correctly from the frontend UI
Large files are handled properly without memory issues
Files are stored in Supabase with correct schema-based bucket names
Upload messages appear in the correct chronological order in conversations
The system properly associates uploads with the current topic
Future Improvements
Update the database schema to fix foreign key constraints pointing to public schema
Review and standardize property naming (snake_case vs. camelCase) across the application
Implement streaming uploads for even better memory management
Add file type validation and size limits in the frontend
Key Files Modified
backend/services/fileProcessing.js: Memory-efficient file processing
backend/routes/api/fileUploads.js: API endpoint handling and error logging
frontend/src/components/MessageArea.js: Client-side upload handling and turn index calculation
The system is now fully operational, with file uploads properly integrated into the topic-based architecture of the application.
