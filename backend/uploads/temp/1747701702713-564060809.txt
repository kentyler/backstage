[⚠️ Suspicious Content] Key Points for Your LLM Interface App Architecture
Core Database Schema

Unified Conversations Table

Store prompts and responses together in a single record
Include a topic_path field using PostgreSQL's ltree type
Add embedding vector field for semantic search


File Handling Approach

Treat file uploads as special conversation entries
Store file metadata (name, type, size, path) in conversations table
Use is_file_upload boolean flag to identify file entries
Store LLM-generated file summaries as the "response" text


Embedding Strategy

Create two embeddings for files: summary_embedding and content_embedding
Use both embeddings for comprehensive search capability
Start with flat search across all files regardless of topic hierarchy


Comments Implementation

Connect comments directly to conversation IDs
Allow threading with parent_comment_id field
Include comments when building context for new prompts



Hierarchical Topic Index

Topic Paths Implementation

Store topic paths in a dedicated topic_paths table
Enable creation of topic hierarchies independent of conversations
Use PostgreSQL's efficient ltree indexing on the paths
Format paths as 'site1.studygroup.llms' for ltree compatibility
Track creation metadata (created_by, created_on) for audit purposes


Topic Path Indexing

Create a GIST index on the topic_paths table for efficient hierarchical operations
Support path-based operations (<@, @>, ~) for efficient tree traversal
Dynamically discover the hierarchy from existing paths
Enable folder-like topic creation without requiring associated content


Type-Ahead Topic Selection

Implement prefix matching for topic path selection using the indexed paths
Create trigram-based indexes for partial path matching
Offer suggestions as users type topic paths



sql-- Enable required extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS ltree;

-- Index for topic path lookups
CREATE INDEX conversations_topic_path_id_idx ON conversations(topic_path_id);

-- Create the topic_paths table
CREATE TABLE dev.topic_paths (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    path ltree NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_by INTEGER REFERENCES participants(id),
    created_on TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT valid_path CHECK (path IS NOT NULL)
);

-- Create the GIST index for efficient hierarchical operations
CREATE INDEX topic_paths_path_idx ON dev.topic_paths USING GIST (path);


Database Connection Management

Connection Pool Pattern

- Use request-scoped connection pools to support dynamic schema selection
- Pass connection pool instances to database operation functions
- Set schema search path at the pool level for each request
- Enables multi-tenant isolation through schema-based separation
- Ensures consistent schema context across all database operations in a request

Implementation Details

- Create connection pool per request in middleware
- Attach pool to request object (req.clientPool)
- Pass pool to all database operation functions
- Release pool connections after request completion
- Maintain consistent transaction scope within request lifecycle

Key SQL Tables
sql-- Main conversations table
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  topic_path_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES topic_paths(id),
  prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
  response TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  
  -- File fields
  is_file_upload BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  file_name TEXT,
  file_type TEXT,
  file_size INTEGER,
  storage_path TEXT,
  
  -- Embeddings
  summary_embedding vector(1536),
  content_embedding vector(1536)
);

-- Comments table
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  conversation_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES conversations(id),
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  parent_comment_id INTEGER REFERENCES comments(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
Search Functionality

Dual Search Approach

Topic-based search: Find conversations in the same hierarchy branch
Vector-based search: Find semantically similar content regardless of topic


Context Building Process

Query both topic hierarchy and vector similarity
Include relevant file content and summaries
Add selected comments for additional context
Format everything properly for LLM prompt


Initial Flat Search Implementation

Search across all files regardless of topic location
Avoid premature categorization constraints
Allow discovery of connections across different topic areas



Future Evolution Path

Data-Driven Refinement

Start with 0% topic hierarchy weighting
Track which files are actually helpful in responses
Gradually introduce topic relevance as a factor (20-30%)
Allow user control over topic priority vs. semantic similarity


Progressive Enhancements

User-specific relevance weighting
Time decay for older files
Topic affinity detection based on usage patterns
Consider adding a topic_metadata table only if extensive metadata becomes necessary
