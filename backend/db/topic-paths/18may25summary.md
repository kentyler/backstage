Morning Summary: Related Messages Feature Implementation
What We Accomplished
Successfully implemented relevant messages search using vector similarity in the backend
Fixed database schema mismatch by changing the id column in topic_paths table from integer to text
Updated topic path keys to match the format used in grp_con_avatar_turns.topicpathid (values like "1_0", "1_1_0")
Enhanced the frontend UI to display these related messages with topic paths and relevance scores
Technical Details
We're using vector similarity search (<-> operator in PostgreSQL) to find semantically related messages
Messages are filtered to exclude the current conversation (topicpathid != $2)
We've set a relevance threshold of 0.95 in the distance metric to ensure quality matches
The UI displays relevance as a percentage score
Database Challenges We Resolved
Schema Mismatch Issue:
In topic_paths table, the id column was defined as integer type
But in grp_con_avatar_turns table, the topicpathid values were text-based IDs like "1_0", "1_1_0"
This caused our JOIN statement to fail: LEFT JOIN topic_paths tp ON CAST(m.topicpathid AS INTEGER) = tp.id
Console logs showed all topicPath values coming back as null
Debugging Process:
Added detailed logging in findSimilarMessages function to inspect the actual values
Found that our database query was finding messages but topic paths were null
Discovered mismatch between database schema and code expectations
Examined TopicsMenu.js which showed the legitimate paths from the frontend
Solution Implemented:
Modified database schema: changed topic_paths.id from integer to text
Used SQL migration: created temporary column, copied data, dropped constraints, renamed column
Manually updated keys to maintain consistency
Retained JOIN approach in the query instead of working around with string manipulation
Current Implementation
Backend: When a new assistant response is generated, we:
Create an embedding vector
Store it in the database
Use that same embedding to find similar messages
Include these relevant messages in the API response
Frontend: When receiving the response:
Process the assistant's answer
Display any relevant messages in the right panel
Show the topic path and relevance score for each message
Tomorrow's Tasks
Test the feature end-to-end now that the database schema is fixed
Verify the SQL JOIN is now working with the updated schema
Adjust the UI if needed to make topic paths more readable/user-friendly
Consider adding pagination if there are many relevant messages
Document the feature for future reference
Potential Improvements
Add ability to exclude certain topics from relevant message search
Implement caching for frequently accessed embeddings
Create admin controls to adjust similarity thresholds
Add logging and analytics to measure feature effectiveness
This summary should help you quickly pick up where we left off and continue with the implementation.
