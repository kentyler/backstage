Task: Fix Database Connection Issues and Create Task Summary System

Problem:
The application was experiencing several errors when trying to fetch page content:
1. "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'query')" when getting LLM ID from preferences
2. "TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON" when getting available LLMs
3. "Connection terminated unexpectedly" when getting groups by participant

These errors were preventing users from accessing content and using the application effectively.

Root Cause Analysis:
After investigating the codebase, I identified several issues:

1. Schema determination logic was scattered across multiple files:
   - `setClientSchema.js` middleware determined the schema based on hostname
   - `clientSchema.js` utility had a separate `determineClientSchema` function
   - `schema.js` had functions for getting/setting the default schema

2. The middleware chain had unnecessary dependencies:
   - `setClientSchema` middleware set `req.clientSchema`
   - Other middleware and routes depended on this property
   - This created a tight coupling between components

3. Function parameter mismatches:
   - `getAvailableLLMs` expected a schema string but was being passed a connection pool object
   - This caused serialization errors when trying to convert the pool to JSON

4. Redundant middleware:
   - `authWithSchema` combined `requireAuth` and `setClientSchema`
   - This added complexity without providing significant benefits

Solution:
I implemented a comprehensive solution:

1. Consolidated schema determination logic:
   - Converted `setClientSchema.js` from a middleware to a utility module
   - Centralized schema determination functions in one place
   - Made the functions reusable across the application

2. Improved connection pool management:
   - Updated `setClientPool.js` to determine the schema directly
   - Eliminated the intermediate `req.clientSchema` property
   - Reduced dependencies between middleware

3. Fixed function parameter handling:
   - Modified `getAvailableLLMs` to accept either a connection pool or schema name
   - Added type checking to handle both cases correctly
   - Improved error handling and logging

4. Simplified middleware chain:
   - Removed the redundant `authWithSchema.js` middleware
   - Updated routes to use `requireAuth` and `setClientPool` directly
   - Made the middleware chain more explicit and easier to understand

5. Eliminated `req.clientSchema` references:
   - Removed all uses of `req.clientSchema` from the codebase
   - Updated code to either use `req.clientPool` directly or determine the schema when needed
   - Improved consistency and reduced potential for errors

Results:
The changes successfully resolved all three error types:

1. "Cannot read properties of null" - Fixed by ensuring proper pool creation and usage
2. "Converting circular structure to JSON" - Fixed by updating `getAvailableLLMs` to handle pool objects
3. "Connection terminated unexpectedly" - Fixed by improving connection pool management

Additional benefits include:
- Simplified code with clearer responsibilities
- Reduced dependencies between components
- More consistent approach to schema determination
- Better error handling and logging
- Improved maintainability for future development

Additional Work - Task Summary System:
After fixing the database connection issues, I created a system to store task summaries (like this one) as text files in a dedicated folder:

1. Created a script (`download-task-summaries.js`) that:
   - Creates the task_summary folder if it doesn't exist
   - Copies existing task summaries into this folder
   - Provides functionality to save new task summaries
   - Allows listing all task summaries in the folder

2. Created documentation (`task_summary/README.md`) that:
   - Explains how the system works
   - Provides instructions for using the script
   - Includes best practices for creating task summaries

This system allows developers to preserve knowledge about completed tasks in a searchable format, making it easier to find and reference past work.
